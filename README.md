# 🪙 Simple Token Transfer Contract

A Fungible Token Smart Contract on Stacks

---

## 📘 Project Description

Simple Token is a secure, feature-rich fungible token smart contract developed in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain. It enables users to mint, burn, transfer tokens, and deposit STX. Designed with strict access control and thoughtful error handling, the contract ensures only authorized interactions are permitted, while also maintaining flexibility for future enhancements. It follows the SIP-010 token standard for compatibility and ease of integration.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

The goal of Simple Token is to provide a clean, minimalistic, yet powerful template for fungible token contracts on the Stacks blockchain. It aims to serve as a secure foundation for more complex decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or custom token utilities in future Web3 projects. By prioritizing clarity, modularity, and strong test coverage, this project aspires to set a high standard for Clarity-based token development.

## ✨ Key Features

* 🔐 **Owner-controlled initialization** of token supply
* 🔄 **Token transfers** with support for optional memos
* 🛠️ **Minting and burning functionality**, restricted to authorized users
* 💰 **STX deposit tracking**, allowing users to deposit native tokens
* 📊 **Read-only metadata access** for name, symbol, decimals, balances, and total supply
* ⚠️ **Error handling** with clear error codes (`u100` to `u103`)
* 🛡️ **Strict ownership enforcement** to protect sensitive actions
* ✅ **SIP-010 compatible design** for seamless ecosystem integration

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

* 🔁 Add automated token distribution mechanisms (e.g., airdrops or vesting)
* 🧾 Enable withdrawal of deposited STX
* 🔗 Integration with front-end dApps (e.g., React or Next.js UI)
* 🧪 CI/CD pipeline for automated contract testing and deployment
* 🔐 Role-based access control for multi-admin capabilities
* 🏛️ Governance features for decentralized decision making
* 🔄 Cross-chain bridge compatibility
* 📈 Advanced DeFi integrations (staking, yield farming)
* 🎯 NFT marketplace integration capabilities
* 🔒 Multi-signature wallet support
