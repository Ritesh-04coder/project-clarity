📘 Project Title
Simple Token (SIMPLE) — A Fungible Token Smart Contract on Stacks

🧾 Project Description
Simple Token is a secure, feature-rich fungible token smart contract developed in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain. It enables users to mint, burn, transfer tokens, and deposit STX. Designed with strict access control and thoughtful error handling, the contract ensures only authorized interactions are permitted, while also maintaining flexibility for future enhancements. It follows the SIP-010 token standard for compatibility and ease of integration.

🎯 Project Vision
The goal of Simple Token is to provide a clean, minimalistic, yet powerful template for fungible token contracts on the Stacks blockchain. It aims to serve as a secure foundation for more complex decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or custom token utilities in future Web3 projects. By prioritizing clarity, modularity, and strong test coverage, this project aspires to set a high standard for Clarity-based token development.

✨ Key Features
🔐 Owner-controlled initialization of token supply

🔄 Token transfers with support for optional memos

🛠️ Minting and burning functionality, restricted to authorized users

💰 STX deposit tracking, allowing users to deposit native tokens

📊 Read-only metadata access for name, symbol, decimals, balances, and total supply

⚠️ Error handling with clear error codes (u100 to u103)

🛡️ Strict ownership enforcement to protect sensitive actions

✅ SIP-010 compatible design for seamless ecosystem integration

🔮 Future Scope
🔁 Add automated token distribution mechanisms (e.g., airdrops or vesting)

🧾 Enable withdrawal of deposited STX

🔗 Integration with front-end dApps (e.g., React or Next.js UI)

🧪 CI/CD pipeline for automated contract testing and deployment

🔐 Role-based access control for multi-admin capabilities

🧪 Test Coverage
All core functionalities are thoroughly tested using Vitest in the Clarinet Simnet environment:

✅ Valid and invalid initialization

✅ Token transfers (with ownership and balance checks)

✅ Minting and burning restrictions

✅ STX deposit and balance tracking

✅ Metadata verification (name, symbol, decimals)

✅ Edge case handling (zero transfers, over-burns, etc.)
